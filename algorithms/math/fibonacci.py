'''
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Like for example first two terms of a sequence are 0 and 1. Now its fibonacci sequence will be as follows.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.
